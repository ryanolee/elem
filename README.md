elem.php

--------------------
This project was my second major project in PHP.  It is a simple DOM manipulation tool with a HTML Parser build in using an ungodly amount of  RegEx. It uses it's own object representation of the DOM and functions a lot like jQuery. 

The parser is incomplete and really hates malformed HTML. It even fails to follow any RFC standards! But hey, you live and you learn. Hopefully this is useful to someone down the line.
